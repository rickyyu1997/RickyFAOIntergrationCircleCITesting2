# Inventory push to Shopify

This stack is responsible for getting inventory information from NewStore and updating the inventory on Shopify and it's composed by 3 lambdas.

# Setup

Create an entry in AWS Systems Manager Params Store - `/frankandoak/[stage]/shopify/dc_location_id_map`:

    {
      "DIXST": {
		    "cad": "61464969372",
		    "usd": "62202544304"
	    },
      [...]
    }

This should map all the location IDs from Shopify to the location IDs in NewStore.


## Lambda functions
 - inventory_create_export_job: Here's where everything begins. It is triggered by a CloudWatch event everyday and is responsible for creating the inventory export job at NewStore. At the end it calls the inventory_push_to_queue lambda.
 - inventory_push_to_queue: After the export job is created by the inventory_create_export_job lambda it calls this lambda that is responsible for pushing information into a queue. At the end it calls the inventory_push_to_shopify lambda.
 - inventory_push_to_shopify: This lambda is called by the inventory_push_to_queue and is responsible for reading the queue and pushing the information of inventory to Shopify.
